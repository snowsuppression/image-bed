A chaotic, overgrown vivarium within a demonic castle (影堕之宫), a humid jungle of bizarre, glowing flora and pulsating, alien-like plants, no sentient life visible. Tangled vines and luminescent fungi cover every surface. Glass tanks and enchanted enclosures hint at unseen, monstrous creatures within, but the space itself is devoid of humanoid presence. Strange liquids bubble in alchemical apparatus. Art style of a vibrant, slightly grotesque fantasy illustration, like Brian Froud meets H.R. Giger, bioluminescence, detailed, sense of untamed, dangerous nature. --ar 16:9 --style raw --chaos 25 --no people, elves, scientists, human figures
